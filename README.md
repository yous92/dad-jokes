- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yous92/dad-jokes.git
cd dad-jokes
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

1. **API Rate Limiting**: The icanhazdadjoke.com API has built-in rate limiting
2. **Content Security**: All jokes are family-friendly and moderated by icanhazdadjoke.com
3. **No User Data Collection**: The application doesn't collect or store any user data
4. **Static Content**: All static content is served via HTTPS (Bootstrap CDN)

### Security Best Practices

1. **Deploy with HTTPS**: Always serve the application over HTTPS in production
2. **Update Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
3. **Input Validation**: All API responses are validated before displaying
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
5. **Headers**: Use security headers in production (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Potential Security Risks

1. **API Dependency**: Relies on external API (icanhazdadjoke.com) - implement fallback mechanism
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on your server to prevent abuse
3. **XSS Protection**: While Bootstrap provides some protection, implement CSP in production

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching**: Implement joke caching to reduce API calls
2. **Minification**: Minify static assets in production
3. **Compression**: Enable Gzip compression
4. **Browser Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers
